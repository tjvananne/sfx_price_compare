I was just working on finishing up the itemlookup_parse function. I think it's pretty much done. 
It wouldn't hurt to add some try/catch blocks in there though. Then in case of a failure, we should
write out the ASIN and timestamp to the error log table (yet to be created in mysql)

I also want some really flexible functions for inserting records into the database.
I'm thinking for single row this'll be easy. loop through names and values and build
the query that way. For dataframes > 1 row, we'll have to look into the data.frame to
database table functions. I think I remember there being something like that.
